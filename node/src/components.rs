/// Core Component.
///
/// A component implements a state machine, not unlike a [Mealy
/// automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine). Its inputs are `Event`s, allowing it to
/// perform work whenever an event is received, outputting `Effect`s each time it is called.
///
/// # Error and halting states
///
/// Components in general are expected to be able to handle every input (`Event`) in every state.
/// Invalid inputs are supposed to be discarded, and the machine is expected to recover from any
/// recoverable error states by itself.
///
/// If a fatal error occurs that is not recoverable, the reactor should be notified instead.
///
/// # Component events and reactor events
///
/// Each component has two events related to it: An associated `Event` and a reactor event (`REv`).
/// The `Event` type indicates what type of event a component accepts, these are typically event
/// types specific to the component.
///
/// Components place restrictions on reactor events (`REv`s), indicating what kind of effects they
/// need to be able to produce to operate.
